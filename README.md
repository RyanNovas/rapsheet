COMING SOON TO A RAPSHEET NEAR YOU 

## Background

We set out to have fun building something new. We also were curious about how to create an app that could integrate well on a mobile device.

We decided to work with the Twilio API to create a user experience that everyone could use - text messages. We wanted a simple, fast UX with a minimal front-end.

## Features

*JUST BIZZNESS*

## Usage

*PRESIDENT BIZZNESS*

## Development/Contribution

Fork the Repo, submit a PR, hit one of us up on Twitter - the main objective of this project was to build something fun and to get people up during their afternoon lull.
